The assignment involves:
1. Segmentation/binarization of skin cancer images using CNNs. 
2. Classification of images into Melanoma and Non-melanoma using CNNs. 

For segmentation, U-Net architecture for CNN is used, and the best test accuracy of 91.41% is obtained.
For classification, an architecture similar to LeNet is used and F1 scores for the classes obtained are: 

Melanoma: F1 - 0.36123348
Precision score - 0.31297709923664124
Recall score - 0.4270833333333333

Non melanoma: F1 - 0.81241915
